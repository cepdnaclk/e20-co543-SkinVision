# SkinVision: Skin Tone, Texture and Health Analyzer
___

"SkinVision: Skin Tone, Texture and Health Analyzer" aims to develop an advanced system that leverages image processing and artificial intelligence to analyze skin images.<br> The system focuses on three key aspects:
<ul>
  <li>Accurately determining skin tone</li>
  <li>Assessing texture (smoothness or roughness)
  <li>Evaluating healthiness metrics like redness, blemishes, and wrinkles</li>
</ul><br>
By automating these tasks, the project addresses the limitations of subjective and manual skin evaluations, offering a reliable, real-time, and accessible solution for dermatology, cosmetics, and personal skin health monitoring.
